# Two-Pass-Assembler, Spring 2017
This is a project for my Spring 2017 Compiler Theory class. It is a simple two pass assembler to turn an assembly language into binary instructions.

Full details for the assignment are available in TwoPassAssemblerAssignment.pdf

The first pass generates the symbol table, and the second pass generates the binary output file.
